# World Weather Analysis
## Overview of Project
Using weather data retrieved from "Open Weather Map" users from PlanMyTrip will be able to select a destination based on their weather preferences.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to provide real-time suggestions for the client's ideal vacations. Based on the MAX and MIN temperatures the client will be able to choose from a list of cities to choose from. The results will show a suggested hotel in each possible destination; additionally they will be able to visualize a tour around selected cities.
### Results
- Weather Database. Random coordinates are generated and matched to cities to create a database for the user to choose from.
- Vacation Search. Given the chosen MIN/MAX temperatures the database will be filtered to get the potential destinations, a recommended hotel will be attached to each possible
match.
